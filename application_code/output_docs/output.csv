Purpose
This dashboard tracks and compares the performance of inbound and
outbound sales efforts. It's used by sales leaders, operations, and
marketing to evaluate lead source effectiveness, optimize conversion paths,
and guide future investment.
 *
Key Definitions
 * Inbound Leads : Generated through marketing channels (e.g. website, paid ads, content downloads, webinars)
 * Outbound Leads : Prospected by our BDR team via cold outreach (email, phone, LinkedIn)
 *
Summary Metrics (Q2 2025)
Metric| Inbound| Outbound| Total 
---|---|---|--- 
Leads Created| 1,250| 880| 2,130 
Qualified Opportunities| 460| 320| 780 
Opportunities to Deals| 135| 82| 217 
Win Rate| 29.3%| 25.6%| 27.8% 
Avg. Deal Size| $9,800| $12,300| $10,900 
New ARR| $1.32M| $1.01M| $2.33M 
 
 *
Pipeline Conversion Funnel
Inbound Funnel:
 * Lead to Opp: 36.8%
 * Opp to Close: 29.3%
Outbound Funnel:
 * Lead to Opp: 36.4%
 * Opp to Close: 25.6%
 _Takeaway:_ Inbound leads convert slightly better at each stage, but
outbound wins tend to be larger deals.
 *
Channel Breakdown
Channel| Leads| Opportunities| Win Rate| Notes 
---|---|---|---|--- 
Website Contact Form| 420| 160| 30.6%| Highest-converting inbound source 
Webinars| 280| 95| 28.4%| Highly engaged prospects 
Paid LinkedIn Ads| 220| 78| 24.5%| Good volume, lower intent 
Cold Email (Outbound)| 480| 190| 26.1%| Strongest outbound source 
Cold Calling| 250| 85| 23.5%| Improving after call script refresh 
 
 *
Insights & Recommendations
 Inbound investments are paying off -- especially through webinars and
gated content.
️ Outbound email conversion is plateauing -- recommend testing new copy
variants in Q3.
 Average deal size for outbound is higher -- double down on outbound for
enterprise prospects.
 Next Review: August 5, 2025 (Q3 Midpoint Review)

2\. Funds‐Transfer Pricing (FTP) Model
> FTP aligns business‐unit margins with the bank's actual cost of liquidity
> and interest‐rate risk.
2.1 Core Formula
FTP Ratei,t=rbase,t+Δliquidity,t+ΔIRRBB,t+Δoptionalities,i\text{FTP
Rate}_{i,t}= r_{\text{base},t} + \Delta_{\text{liquidity},t} +
\Delta_{\text{IRRBB},t} + \Delta_{\text{optionalities},i}
Component| Source| Notes 
---|---|--- 
rbase,tr_{\text{base},t}| 1‐month CDOR curve| Updated daily by Treasury 
Δliquidity,t\Delta_{\text{liquidity},t}| Liquidity desk| Cost of maintaining
LCR ≥ 105 % & NSFR ≥ 110 % 
ΔIRRBB,t\Delta_{\text{IRRBB},t}| ALM| Interest‐rate risk in the banking book
shock (±200 bp) 
Δoptionalities,i\Delta_{\text{optionalities},i}| Product desk| Prepayment,
drawdown, and conversion options (see _Loan Products_ page) 
 
 *
3\. Economic Capital Allocation (ECA)
> Ensures each business line carries its share of unexpected loss (UL) at the
> bank's 99.9 % confidence level.
3.1 UL Calculation
UL=∑j=1nσj2+2 ⁣ ⁣ ⁣∑j≠k ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ρjk σjσk\text{UL} = \sqrt{ \sum_{j=1}^{n}
\sigma_j^2 + 2 \\!\\!\\!\sum_{j\neq k}\\!\\!\\! \rho_{jk}\,\sigma_j \sigma_k }
 * σj\sigma_j: standalone volatility of portfolio _j_
 * ρjk\rho_{jk}: asset‐class correlation from Basel III IRC tables
Business Unit| Stand‐Alone UL (MM$)| Capital Diversification Benefit| Final
Allocated Capital 
---|---|---|--- 
Retail Loans| 250| 15 %| 212 
Credit Cards| 140| 10 %| 126 
Commercial| 310| 18 %| 254 
Treasury & Trading| 190| 0 %| 190 
 
Allocated capital feeds the RAROC engine:
RAROC=Net Income after TaxEconomic Capital\text{RAROC}= \frac{\text{Net Income
after Tax}}{\text{Economic Capital}}
> Target RAROC: ≥ 15 % to exceed hurdle rate and dividend expectations.
 *
4\. Stress‐Testing Workflow
Step| Scenario Driver| Key Metric Tested| Linked Detail 
---|---|---|--- 
1| 300 bp rate shock| Net Interest Income (NII)| FTP & ALM deck 
2| Unemployment ↑ 5 ppt| PD migration for _Retail Loans_| Formulas on [Loan
Products & Value Creation] 
3| Housing prices ↓ 15 %| LGD for mortgages, HELOCs| Collateral tables in
_Loan Products_ 
4| Oil price ↓ 35 %| Sector EAD stress (_Commercial_)| Industry slots on
_Business Banking Solutions_ 
 
Output flows into capital‐planning and ICAAP documentation.
 *
5\. Pricing & Profitability Engine (Advanced)
5.1 Risk‐Adjusted Spread Objective
Target Spread=FTP Rate+Expected Loss+Opex Load+Target RAROC×Economic
CapitalEarning Assets\text{Target Spread}= \text{FTP Rate} + \text{Expected
Loss} + \text{Opex Load} + \text{Target RAROC} \times \frac{\text{Economic
Capital}}{\text{Earning Assets}}
 * Expected Loss: PD × LGD × EAD _(PD grids linked to our internal Credit Score Basics article)_
 * Opex Load: Activity‐based cost allocation (ABC)
5.2 Example - Small‐Business Term Loan
Item| Value 
---|--- 
FTP Rate| 4.15 % 
Expected Loss| 0.80 % 
Opex Load| 0.65 % 
Capital/Assets| 8 % 
Target RAROC| 15 % 
 
Target Spread=4.15+0.80+0.65+0.15×0.08=6.02%\text{Target Spread} = 4.15 + 0.80
+ 0.65 + 0.15 \times 0.08 = 6.02\%
Quoted all‐in fixed rate: 6.05 % (rounding buffer).
 *
6\. Performance Dashboard Metrics
Metric| Threshold| Source Page 
---|---|--- 
Net Interest Margin (NIM) ≥ 2.50 %| Formulas cheat‐sheet| _Formulas_ page 
Cost‐to‐Income Ratio ≤ 48 %| Ops Finance| -- 
Non‐Performing Loans / Gross Loans ≤ 0.75 %| Credit Risk| _Loan Products_ 
LCR ≥ 105 %| Treasury| -- 
CET1 Ratio ≥ 11.0 %| Regulatory Capital| -- 
 
 *
7\. Governance & Controls
 * Model Validation: Independent validation team reviews FTP, PD/LGD/EAD, and stress models annually.
 * Policy Alignment: All assumptions adhere to OSFI Guideline _E‐16_ and Basel III Pillar 2.
 * Audit Trail: Confluence pages are version‐controlled; key formulas also stored in Model Inventory DB (#FIN‐MODELS).

 *
Competitor A - Nexora
Overview: 
Nexora is a legacy player strong in enterprise markets but known for outdated
UX.
Strengths:
 * Deep customization for large clients
 * Longstanding industry reputation
 * Broad partner network
Weaknesses:
 * Steep learning curve
 * Poor mobile experience
 * Slow release cycles
Positioning Tips:
> ""While Nexora offers depth, our customers tell us they switched because they
> needed a more intuitive and agile solution. We release product updates
> weekly, not quarterly.""
 *
Competitor B - FlowLogic
Overview: 
A startup gaining traction in SMB markets with sleek design and low price.
Strengths:
 * Attractive pricing
 * Simple onboarding
 * Active user community
Weaknesses:
 * Limited scalability
 * Missing enterprise features (custom roles, API limits)
 * No phone support
Positioning Tips:
> ""FlowLogic is great for teams just getting started -- but as you scale,
> you'll want a platform that grows with you, not one you'll outgrow.""
 *
Competitor C - RevStack
Overview: 
Known for automation features, but often overpromises on integrations.
Strengths:
 * Advanced workflow automation
 * AI-powered reporting
 * Strong outbound toolset
Weaknesses:
 * Integration bugs with Salesforce
 * Expensive add-ons
 * Limited support hours
Positioning Tips:
> ""RevStack talks a big game about automation, but we consistently hear about
> failed integrations. With us, native Salesforce sync just works -- out of
> the box.""

️ Talk Tracks & Objection Handling
Objection| Response 
---|--- 
""We're already using Nexora.""| ""Totally understand. We've helped many former
Nexora clients reduce training time by 40% -- would it be worth exploring if
we could do the same for you?"" 
""FlowLogic is cheaper.""| ""Absolutely -- and if cost is the only factor,
they're a great fit. But if ROI and support matter too, let's walk through
where we deliver more long-term value."" 
""RevStack has better automation.""| ""They do a lot in theory. We've found that
teams prefer functionality they can rely on -- especially when it comes to
clean Salesforce data.""

 Remote Work Eligibility
Employees may be eligible to work remotely if:
 * The role does not require on-site presence
 * Performance and communication standards are consistently met
 * They reside in an approved geographic region (due to legal or payroll constraints)

 Performance & Feedback
All employees -- remote, hybrid, or in-office -- are held to the same
performance standards. Performance reviews, feedback cycles, and career growth
processes apply equally across all work modes.
 *
 Frequently Asked Questions
Q: Can I temporarily work from another city or country?
Requests are considered case-by-case. Please consult HR before making travel
plans.

 ### Internal Formula Cheat‐Sheet - Maple Trust Bank
| Formula| Variables & Notes 
---|---|--- 
 
 1. Net Interest Margin (NIM)
| NIM=Interest Income−Interest ExpenseAverage Earning Assets\displaystyle
\text{NIM}= \frac{\text{Interest Income}-\text{Interest
Expense}}{\text{Average Earning Assets}}| Measures spread the bank earns on
core lending & investing activities. 
 
 2. Adjusted Return on Risk‐Weighted Assets (ARRWA)
| ARRWA=Net Income−Expected Credit LossesRisk‐Weighted Assets\displaystyle
\text{ARRWA}= \frac{\text{Net Income}-\text{Expected Credit
Losses}}{\text{Risk‐Weighted Assets}}| Filters out credit‐loss drag to show
risk‐adjusted profitability. 
 
 3. Liquidity Stress Ratio (LSR)
| LSR=High‐Quality Liquid Assets−30‐Day Net Cash OutflowsTotal Funding
Liabilities\displaystyle \text{LSR}= \frac{\text{High‐Quality Liquid
Assets}-\text{30‐Day Net Cash Outflows}}{\text{Total Funding Liabilities}}| >
1 ⇒ comfortable liquidity cushion under 30‐day stress. 
 
 4. Dynamic Loan Pricing
| Offer Rate=r0+(k1PD+k2LGD+k3EAD)+COF+Target Margin\displaystyle \text{Offer
Rate}=r_0 + \bigl(k_1PD + k_2LGD + k_3EAD\bigr) + \text{COF} + \text{Target
Margin}| _r0_ : base rate (e.g., 1‐month CDOR). _PD_ , _LGD_ , _EAD_ : Basel
credit‐risk drivers. _COF_ : cost of funds. 
 
 5. Credit‐Card Expected Loss per Account
| EL=(Monthly Spend×PD×LGD)−(Annual Fee×Retention Rate)\displaystyle EL =
\bigl(\text{Monthly Spend}\times PD \times LGD\bigr)-\bigl(\text{Annual
Fee}\times \text{Retention Rate}\bigr)| Captures charge‐off risk net of fee
income. 
 
 6. Savings‐Account Growth Projection
| Bt=P ⁣(1+rm)mt+∑i=1nDi ⁣(1+rm)m (t−ti)\displaystyle
B_t=P\\!\left(1+\frac{r}{m}\right)^{mt}+ \sum_{i=1}^{n}
D_i\\!\left(1+\frac{r}{m}\right)^{m\,(t-t_i)}| _P_ : opening balance. _r_ :
annual rate. _m_ : compounding freq. _Di_ : periodic deposits. 
 
 7. Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)
| CLV=∑t=1TNet Revenuet−Costt(1+d)t\displaystyle \text{CLV}=
\sum_{t=1}^{T}\frac{\text{Net Revenue}_t-\text{Cost}_t}{(1+d)^t}| Discounted
cash‐flow of a relationship; _d_ = hurdle rate. 
 
 8. Risk‐Adjusted Net Interest Income (RANII)
| RANII=(Interest Income×(1−PD))−Interest Expense−(Credit
Cost×LGD)\displaystyle \text{RANII}= \bigl(\text{Interest
Income}\times(1-PD)\bigr)-\text{Interest Expense}-\bigl(\text{Credit
Cost}\times LGD\bigr)| Shows ""clean"" NII after expected loss provisioning."

 ## 1\. Introduction
Maple Trust Bank offers a range of loan solutions designed to meet personal,
household, and business needs while maintaining sustainable profitability.
Each product balances fair pricing for customers with prudent risk‐adjusted
returns for the bank, allowing us to reinvest in better services, digital
innovation, and community programs.
 *
2\. Personal & Consumer Loans
Loan Type| Typical Purpose| Customer Benefits| Bank Value Creation* 
---|---|---|--- 
 Personal Installment Loan| Debt consolidation, major purchases| Fixed
rate, predictable payments; quick approval| Net Interest Margin (NIM) on
amortizing balance; modest origination fee 
Auto Loan| New or used vehicle financing| Competitive fixed rates;
pre‐approval at dealership| Partnership subsidies with dealers; cross‐sell
insurance 
Line of Credit (LoC)| Flexible short‐term borrowing| Interest charged
only on drawn amount; reusable limit| Variable‐rate spread above prime;
commitment fee on unused limit 
Student Loan| Tuition, textbooks, living expenses| Interest subsidy while
in school; flexible repayment| Long‐term relationship, graduate upsell to
other products 
Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC)| Renovations, large expenses| Lower
rate secured by home equity; interest‐only option| Secured spread below
unsecured LoC; collateral reduces credit losses 
 
 * How the Bank Profits:
 
Profit=(Interest Rate−Cost of Funds−Expected Loss)×Outstanding
Principal+Fees\displaystyle \text{Profit} = (\text{Interest Rate} - \text{Cost
of Funds} - \text{Expected Loss}) \times \text{Outstanding Principal} +
\text{Fees}
 *
3\. Mortgage Lending
Product Variant| Key Features| Customer Benefits| Profit Drivers 
---|---|---|--- 
Fixed‐Rate Mortgage| 1‐, 3‐, 5‐, or 10‐year terms| Payment stability|
Spread locked for term; breakage fees 
Variable‐Rate Mortgage| Rate floats with prime (caps available)| Benefit
if rates fall; convertible to fixed| Variable spread; lower duration risk 
Cashback Mortgage| Lump‐sum cashback at funding| Up‐front funds for
closing costs| Slightly higher rate offsets cashback 
Newcomer & First‐Time Buyer Program| Reduced down‐payment, advice bundle|
Easier entry into housing market| CMHC‐insured, minimizes credit risk 
 
Economic Model: Mortgages create a long‐duration asset funded primarily by
low‐cost deposits, producing stable net interest income. Ancillary revenue:
mortgage life insurance, homeowner's insurance referrals, and retention when
clients renew.
 *
4\. Business & Commercial Lending
Facility| Typical Use Case| Customer Benefits| Bank Profit Logic 
---|---|---|--- 
Term Loan| Equipment purchase, expansion| Fixed amortization aligns with
asset life| Asset‐backed collateral lowers LGD1 
Operating Line| Working‐capital swings| Revolving credit; interest only
on used balance| Prime‐based pricing with standby fee on undrawn portion 
Commercial Mortgage| Office, retail, industrial property| Long
amortization, predictable payments| Real estate collateral; fee income for
appraisals 
Agricultural Operating Loan| Seed, fertilizer, livestock feed| Seasonal
repayment aligned with harvest cycle| Government guarantee programs reduce
capital charges 
Equipment Leasing| Trucks, heavy machinery| 100 % financing; tax
deductibility| Residual asset value plus lease rate spread 
 
1LGD: Loss Given Default. Lower LGD increases risk‐adjusted return.
 *
5\. Responsible Profit Framework
 1. Risk‐Based Pricing - Rates reflect probability of default (PD) and LGD, ensuring high‐credit customers pay less while higher‐risk loans remain sustainable.
 2. Inclusive Access - Products like Student Loans and Newcomer Mortgages expand financial inclusion, forging long‐term relationships that generate lifetime value.
 3. Cross‐Sell Synergy - Loans often introduce customers to savings, insurance, or investment products, diversifying revenue and boosting customer success.
 4. Capital Efficiency - Careful balance‐sheet management (e.g., securitizing mortgages) frees capital for more lending, amplifying community impact.
 *
6\. Example Profit Calculation
> Five‐Year Fixed Mortgage
>
> * Principal: $400,000
>
> * Rate: 5.29 %
>
> * Cost of Funds: 2.10 %
>
> * Expected Credit Loss: 0.12 %
>
> * Servicing & Capital Cost: 0.60 %
>
>
Net Spread=5.29−2.10−0.12−0.60=2.47%\text{Net Spread}=5.29-2.10-0.12-0.60 =
2.47\%
Annual profit ≈ $400,000 × 2.47 % = $9,880 (before tax). A portion funds
digital upgrades, branch services, and community outreach.
 *
7\. Community Impact
 * Local Job Creation: Lending to small businesses supports employment growth.
 * Financial Education: Loan officers provide budgeting guidance during origination.
 * Housing Affordability: First‐time buyer programs open doors to home ownership.
 * Green Financing: Preferential rates for energy‐efficient home upgrades and electric vehicle loans reduce carbon footprint.

 ### Banking Application - Technical Architecture Overview
 *
Page 1: Overview of Core Banking Architecture
The banking platform is composed of multiple microservices operating within a
secure, scalable, cloud-native infrastructure. The application is deployed
across multiple Availability Zones within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) hosted
on AWS.
Key Highlights:
 * All services are containerized using Docker and orchestrated with Kubernetes (EKS).
 * Private communication is ensured via VPC with private subnets and security groups.
 * Services interact via REST APIs and asynchronous messaging (Kafka).
 * CI/CD pipeline powered by GitHub Actions and ArgoCD.
Core Services:
 * Authentication Service : Handles login, JWT issuance
 * Account Service : Manages user accounts, balances, transactions
 * Transaction Service : Handles fund transfers, payment processing
 * Notification Service : Sends emails, SMS, and push notifications
 * Audit Service : Tracks and stores system events for compliance
 *
Page 2: Network and Infrastructure Design
VPC Configuration:
 * VPC CIDR : `10.0.0.0/16`
 * Subnets :
 * `10.0.1.0/24` (Private Subnet A - Zone A)
 * `10.0.2.0/24` (Private Subnet B - Zone B)
 * `10.0.3.0/24` (Public Subnet A - Zone A)
 * `10.0.4.0/24` (Public Subnet B - Zone B)
Internal DNS Naming:
Service| Internal DNS 
---|--- 
auth-service| `auth.internal.bank.local` 
account-service| `account.internal.bank.local` 
transaction-service| `tx.internal.bank.local` 
audit-service| `audit.internal.bank.local` 
kafka-broker| `kafka.internal.bank.local` 
 
Load Balancer:
 * Public ALB for login & registration: `https://api.bank.com`
 * Internal NLB for internal service-to-service communication
 *
Page 3: API Gateway & Service Communication
Public Endpoints (via API Gateway):
Method| Endpoint| Service 
---|---|--- 
POST| `/api/v1/auth/login`| auth-service 
POST| `/api/v1/accounts`| account-service 
POST| `/api/v1/transactions/transfer`| transaction-service 
 
Internal REST Communication:
 * Auth -> Account: Fetch user roles
 * Transaction -> Account: Validate balance
 * Account -> Audit: Log account changes
Message Topics:
 * `transaction.completed`
 * `account.updated`
 * `user.logged_in`
Services publish/subscribe to Kafka topics using Avro-encoded messages.
 *
Page 4: Security and Compliance
Authentication:
 * All external endpoints secured with OAuth2 (JWT tokens)
 * Tokens validated at API Gateway and downstream services
Network Security:
 * Private services not exposed outside VPC
 * NACLs and Security Groups enforce least privilege access
 * No direct internet access for internal services
Data Protection:
 * All data encrypted at rest (KMS) and in transit (TLS 1.3)
 * Secrets managed via AWS Secrets Manager
Compliance:
 * Logs forwarded to centralized ELK stack with restricted access
 * Data residency policies enforced per region (e.g., CA, EU)
 * Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for all service dashboards
 *
Page 5: Deployment & Monitoring
CI/CD Flow:
 1. Developer pushes code to `main` branch
 2. GitHub Actions runs unit and integration tests
 3. Docker image pushed to Amazon ECR
 4. ArgoCD triggers a deployment to EKS
Monitoring & Observability:
 * Datadog : Metrics and traces
 * ELK Stack : Centralized logging
 * Prometheus + Grafana : Real-time dashboards
 * PagerDuty : Alerting for production incidents
Sample Dashboard Metrics:
 * Transactions per minute
 * Failed logins
 * API latency by endpoint
 * Database query durations
 *
This technical documentation provides a realistic and complete picture of a
modern banking application's backend system. It is designed to assist
engineering, DevOps, and security teams in understanding the technical flow,
integration patterns, and operational structure of the system."
