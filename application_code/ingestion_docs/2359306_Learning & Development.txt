 Our Approach
Our L&D strategy focuses on three pillars:
 1. Core Competencies : Foundational skills for all employees
 2. Role-Specific Training : Tailored for functions, levels, and career paths
 3. Leadership Development : Programs for current and aspiring leaders
We use a mix of formats to support diverse learning styles: workshops,
e-learning, mentoring, coaching, peer learning, and external courses.
