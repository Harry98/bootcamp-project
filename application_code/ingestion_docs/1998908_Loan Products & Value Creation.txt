2\. Personal & Consumer Loans
Loan Type| Typical Purpose| Customer Benefits| Bank Value Creation* 
---|---|---|--- 
 Personal Installment Loan| Debt consolidation, major purchases| Fixed
rate, predictable payments; quick approval| Net Interest Margin (NIM) on
amortizing balance; modest origination fee 
Auto Loan| New or used vehicle financing| Competitive fixed rates;
pre‐approval at dealership| Partnership subsidies with dealers; cross‐sell
insurance 
Line of Credit (LoC)| Flexible short‐term borrowing| Interest charged
only on drawn amount; reusable limit| Variable‐rate spread above prime;
commitment fee on unused limit 
Student Loan| Tuition, textbooks, living expenses| Interest subsidy while
in school; flexible repayment| Long‐term relationship, graduate upsell to
other products 
Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC)| Renovations, large expenses| Lower
rate secured by home equity; interest‐only option| Secured spread below
unsecured LoC; collateral reduces credit losses 
 
 * How the Bank Profits:
 
Profit=(Interest Rate−Cost of Funds−Expected Loss)×Outstanding
Principal+Fees\displaystyle \text{Profit} = (\text{Interest Rate} - \text{Cost
of Funds} - \text{Expected Loss}) \times \text{Outstanding Principal} +
\text{Fees}
 *
3\. Mortgage Lending
Product Variant| Key Features| Customer Benefits| Profit Drivers 
---|---|---|--- 
Fixed‐Rate Mortgage| 1‐, 3‐, 5‐, or 10‐year terms| Payment stability|
Spread locked for term; breakage fees 
Variable‐Rate Mortgage| Rate floats with prime (caps available)| Benefit
if rates fall; convertible to fixed| Variable spread; lower duration risk 
Cashback Mortgage| Lump‐sum cashback at funding| Up‐front funds for
closing costs| Slightly higher rate offsets cashback 
Newcomer & First‐Time Buyer Program| Reduced down‐payment, advice bundle|
Easier entry into housing market| CMHC‐insured, minimizes credit risk 
 
Economic Model: Mortgages create a long‐duration asset funded primarily by
low‐cost deposits, producing stable net interest income. Ancillary revenue:
mortgage life insurance, homeowner's insurance referrals, and retention when
clients renew.

4\. Business & Commercial Lending
Facility| Typical Use Case| Customer Benefits| Bank Profit Logic 
---|---|---|--- 
Term Loan| Equipment purchase, expansion| Fixed amortization aligns with
asset life| Asset‐backed collateral lowers LGD1 
Operating Line| Working‐capital swings| Revolving credit; interest only
on used balance| Prime‐based pricing with standby fee on undrawn portion 
Commercial Mortgage| Office, retail, industrial property| Long
amortization, predictable payments| Real estate collateral; fee income for
appraisals 
Agricultural Operating Loan| Seed, fertilizer, livestock feed| Seasonal
repayment aligned with harvest cycle| Government guarantee programs reduce
capital charges 
Equipment Leasing| Trucks, heavy machinery| 100 % financing; tax
deductibility| Residual asset value plus lease rate spread 
 
1LGD: Loss Given Default. Lower LGD increases risk‐adjusted return.

5\. Responsible Profit Framework
 1. Risk‐Based Pricing - Rates reflect probability of default (PD) and LGD, ensuring high‐credit customers pay less while higher‐risk loans remain sustainable.
 2. Inclusive Access - Products like Student Loans and Newcomer Mortgages expand financial inclusion, forging long‐term relationships that generate lifetime value.
 3. Cross‐Sell Synergy - Loans often introduce customers to savings, insurance, or investment products, diversifying revenue and boosting customer success.
 4. Capital Efficiency - Careful balance‐sheet management (e.g., securitizing mortgages) frees capital for more lending, amplifying community impact.

6\. Example Profit Calculation
> Five‐Year Fixed Mortgage
>
> * Principal: $400,000
>
> * Rate: 5.29 %
>
> * Cost of Funds: 2.10 %
>
> * Expected Credit Loss: 0.12 %
>
> * Servicing & Capital Cost: 0.60 %
>
>
Net Spread=5.29−2.10−0.12−0.60=2.47%\text{Net Spread}=5.29-2.10-0.12-0.60 =
2.47\%
Annual profit ≈ $400,000 × 2.47 % = $9,880 (before tax). A portion funds
digital upgrades, branch services, and community outreach.

7\. Community Impact
 * Local Job Creation: Lending to small businesses supports employment growth.
 * Financial Education: Loan officers provide budgeting guidance during origination.
 * Housing Affordability: First‐time buyer programs open doors to home ownership.
 * Green Financing: Preferential rates for energy‐efficient home upgrades and electric vehicle loans reduce carbon footprint.
