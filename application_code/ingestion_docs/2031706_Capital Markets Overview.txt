5\. Funding & Liquidity Interface
 * Short‐Term Funding: Use of repo, FX swaps, and commercial paper to finance trading inventory.
 * Netting & Collateral: Central Counterparty (CCP) clearing vs. bilateral ISDA CSAs; optimisation reduces Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) drag.
 * Transfer‐Pricing: Treated via Funds‐Transfer Pricing (FTP) rate plus trading‐specific liquidity add‐ons (linked to the FTP methodology in the Advanced Financial Framework page).
 *

Large Exposure Limits| OSFI / Basel concentration limits| Treasury & Risk

 * Model Governance: Quantitative models validated under Guideline E‐16 schedule; refer to Model Inventory page.
 * Trade Surveillance: Automated alerts for pricing anomalies, wash trades, last‐look abuse.
