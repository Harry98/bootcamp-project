Competitor A - Nexora
Overview: 
Nexora is a legacy player strong in enterprise markets but known for outdated
UX.
Strengths:
 * Deep customization for large clients
 * Longstanding industry reputation
 * Broad partner network
Weaknesses:
 * Steep learning curve
 * Poor mobile experience
 * Slow release cycles
Positioning Tips:
> "While Nexora offers depth, our customers tell us they switched because they
> needed a more intuitive and agile solution. We release product updates
> weekly, not quarterly."
 *
Competitor B - FlowLogic
Overview: 
A startup gaining traction in SMB markets with sleek design and low price.
Strengths:
 * Attractive pricing
 * Simple onboarding
 * Active user community
Weaknesses:
 * Limited scalability
 * Missing enterprise features (custom roles, API limits)
 * No phone support
Positioning Tips:
> "FlowLogic is great for teams just getting started -- but as you scale,
> you'll want a platform that grows with you, not one you'll outgrow."
 *
Competitor C - RevStack
Overview: 
Known for automation features, but often overpromises on integrations.
Strengths:
 * Advanced workflow automation
 * AI-powered reporting
 * Strong outbound toolset
Weaknesses:
 * Integration bugs with Salesforce
 * Expensive add-ons
 * Limited support hours
Positioning Tips:
> "RevStack talks a big game about automation, but we consistently hear about
> failed integrations. With us, native Salesforce sync just works -- out of
> the box."

Ô∏è Talk Tracks & Objection Handling
Objection| Response 
---|--- 
"We're already using Nexora."| "Totally understand. We've helped many former
Nexora clients reduce training time by 40% -- would it be worth exploring if
we could do the same for you?" 
"FlowLogic is cheaper."| "Absolutely -- and if cost is the only factor,
they're a great fit. But if ROI and support matter too, let's walk through
where we deliver more long-term value." 
"RevStack has better automation."| "They do a lot in theory. We've found that
teams prefer functionality they can rely on -- especially when it comes to
clean Salesforce data."
