 Overview
We support both fully remote and hybrid work models , depending on
role requirements, team agreements, and geographic considerations.
Work Mode| Description 
---|--- 
 Remote| Employees work entirely outside of a company office location. 
 Hybrid| Employees split time between remote work and office presence. 
 In-Office| Required for roles tied to physical presence or equipment. 
 
Your manager will confirm your role's classification during onboarding or team
planning cycles.

performance standards. Performance reviews, feedback cycles, and career growth
processes apply equally across all work modes.
