️ Core Pitch Script - 30-Second Elevator Pitch
> "We help mid-sized teams automate and streamline their sales workflows so
> they can close more deals, faster -- without the tech headaches. Our
> platform connects directly with your CRM, scores your pipeline in real time,
> and lets your reps focus on selling, not spreadsheets."
 _Use during cold outreach, intro calls, and networking events._

️ Cold Email Script (Outbound Prospecting)
Subject: Quick idea for [Company]'s sales team 
Body:
> Hi [First Name],
>
> I work with companies like [Client A] and [Client B] to help their sales
> teams shorten deal cycles and improve forecast accuracy. Based on what I saw
> about [Company], I think we could help you do the same.
>
> Open to a quick 15-minute call this week to explore?
 Tip: Personalize the second sentence with a recent company news item or
role-specific insight.

Common Objections & How to Handle Them
Objection| Response 
---|--- 
"We're already using another tool."| "That's great -- many of our customers
were too. They found switching helped reduce reporting time by 40% and
improved rep adoption." 
"We don't have budget right now."| "Totally understand. Just to help plan
ahead, when do budget reviews typically happen on your side?" 
"Let me check with my manager."| "Of course. Would it help if we set up a
follow-up with both of you next week?" 
"We're too small for this."| "A lot of our customers said the same -- and now
they're glad they started early. Growth-stage teams benefit the most from
streamlined sales ops."
