 Our Philosophy
 * Clarity : Everyone should know what's expected of them and how success is measured.
 * Consistency : All employees go through the same performance cycle and feedback mechanisms.
 * Development : Growth is not only vertical. We support lateral moves, skill development, and exploration.
 * Recognition : We celebrate contributions and reward high performance.

 Performance Management Cycle
Phase| Timeline| Key Activities 
---|---|--- 
Goal Setting| January / Onboarding| Set SMART goals aligned with team and
company OKRs 
Mid-Year Review| June-July| Self-assessment, manager check-in, course

 Goal Setting & OKRs
We use Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) to align individual goals with
team and company-wide priorities.
> Tip: Set 3-5 goals per cycle. Each goal should be Specific, Measurable,
> Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound (SMART).
 *
 Feedback Culture
 * Real-time : We encourage timely praise and constructive feedback.
 * 360-Degree Reviews : Peer, self, and manager feedback collected at key points.
 * Tools : Use [Lattice]/[Workday]/[Kudos app] to give/receive public and private feedback.
 *
 1:1s With Your Manager
Regular check-ins should include:
 * Progress toward goals
 * Roadblocks or support needed
 * Feedback in both directions
 * Career aspirations and skill development
Recommended frequency: Biweekly or Monthly
 *
 Career Development Pathways
We support growth through:
 Internal Mobility
Employees are encouraged to explore new roles across departments after 12
months in their current position.
 Career Ladders
Each department has defined levels with expectations and competencies. Ask
your People Partner for the ladder relevant to your role.
 Stretch Assignments
Take on projects outside your usual responsibilities to build new skills.
 Mentorship Programs
Formal and informal mentorships are available. Ask HR about our annual
mentorship cohort.
 *
 Calibration & Promotions
 * Managers and HR calibrate reviews across teams for fairness.
 * Promotion decisions are based on:
 * Performance rating
 * Skills and competencies
 * Business need
 * Time in role is a consideration, not a requirement
> Ask your manager for our Promotion Guidelines Deck.
 *
 Recognition & Rewards
 * Spot Bonuses for outstanding performance on critical projects.
 * Quarterly Recognition via company town halls or peer-nominated awards.
 * Milestone Celebrations for work anniversaries, certifications, or major wins.
